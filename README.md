#HTML5 Game Jam entry: *Enterprise*

This is a `<canvas>`-based clone of Amiga/MSDOS game “Syndicate”.

The game is not finished — it was written in 24 hours. Unfortunately you can't kill enemies, but you can shoot rockets by holding <kbd>space</kbd> and it looks awesome :)

**For best performance [use Opera 10.70](http://my.opera.com/desktopteam/blog/).**

In WebKit it supports multitouch trackpad scrolling. Works on iDevices, albeit slowly (iOS3 is useless, iOS4 is tolerable).
